# capstone

This is a work in progress but current features include (not an exhaustive list as we are adding features at a high pace):

- Composable actors, from code or by JSON (`assets/actors.json`)
- RPG mechanics, such as character stats and various abilities, currently contained in items, but a spell and feat system is in the works
- Composable items, from code of by JSON (`assets/items.json`), character inventory and more
- Dynamic resource loading, so textures can be added by editing (`assets/resources.json`) and referenced by `texture_id` in actors and items, both in-code and in the corresponding json-files
- Tiled maps (to be replaced by a proprietary format, as soon as we create an in-game editor)
